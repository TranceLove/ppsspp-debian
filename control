Description: Sony PSP emulator
 PPSSPP can run your PSP games on your PC in full HD resolution. It can even
 upscale textures that would otherwise be too blurry as they were made for
 the small screen of the original PSP.
 .
 All trademarks are property of their respective owners. The emulator is for
 educational and development purposes only and it may not be used to play games
 you do not legally own.
